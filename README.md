## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ... Creating a Home SOC lab in order to create a virtualized business infrastructure that will allow me to simultaneously attack and defend. Also I am currently working towards my B.S in cybersecurity and Information Assurance at WGU.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ... Python / reverse engineering / how to properly use github!
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ... A Key logger project as well as creating a password strength tool. 
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with ... All things Cybersecurity
- âš¡ About ME: ... I have spent over 10 years as a Corporate manager in various retail businesses. I slowly broke down over time and finally realized it was time to follow my passion. My passion for computers started alot later in life than most people primarily because I didnt really have access to them when I was younger, but as of the last 10 years I have developed a strong passion for all things computer related. At this point Ive got computer basics down and have focused alot of my energy learning BASH, powershell, C and SQL. However I am in need of guidance in terms of what paths to go down to acquire the knowledge and skills necessary to be successful in my Cybersecurity goals.
